# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Languages Used
I am currently using Java, Python, and JavaScript. I am trying to learn Go and C++ simultaneously and implement them after I feel comfortable with them.

### Table
I haven't done every implementation in every language so here's a table to make things easier:

|  DS/Algo | C++ | Go | Java | JavaScript | Python |
|----------|-----|----|------|------------|--------|
| Linear Search | In-Progress | [Solution](https://github.com/siradityaverma/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Array/Search/Go/linear_search.go) | In-Progress | In-Progress | In-Progress |
| Binary Search | In-Progress | [Solution](https://github.com/siradityaverma/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Array/Search/Go/binary_search.go) | In-Progress | In-Progress | In-Progress |
| Singly Linked List | In-Progress | In-Progress | [Solution](https://github.com/siradityaverma/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/LinkedList/Java/LinkedList.java) | [Solution](https://github.com/siradityaverma/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/LinkedList/JavaScript) | [Solution](https://github.com/siradityaverma/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/LinkedList/Python/main.py) |
| Doubly Linked List | In-Progress | In-Progress | In-Progress | In-Progress| In-Progress |
| Stack | In-Progress | In-Progress | In-Progress | In-Progress | [Solution](https://github.com/siradityaverma/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Stack/Python/stack.py) |
| Queues | In-Progress | In-Progress | In-Progress | In-Progress | [Solution](https://github.com/siradityaverma/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Queue/Python/queue.py) |
